ANSWER
 
struct data
	{
		char postal[4];
		int population;
	}
is a struct used to store data extracted by the given file we use pointer to size the struct because we do 
not know the the number of postal code before hand. it is provided to us by a function which counts the number of
entries and returns the count.
	
	bool load(const char filename[]);
we use this function to check weather the dat provided is accurate or not and the file is readable or not then if 
everything works fine then we read the value and store it respectively.
file handling was tough but was relatively easy in comparison to that of workshop1 part 2 
struct data
	
	void sort();
	this is used to sort data but it was a function which troubled a lot because it would lead to array index out of bound
	error upon realising that we use j+1 in the code hence it leads to the above mentioned problem.
	we run loop till j-1.
	
	void display();
this function simply display the header of output and the sorted data.
	
	void deallocateMemory();
this function deallocates the data.
