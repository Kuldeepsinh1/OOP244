the following code was extremely difficult due to some reasons like it totally depended
on the handling of text file and like taking data from it and storing it in meaningfull
way like in a structure and then process the data accordingly.

when making a text file to store our new dictionary i was not putting a extra empty line at 
the end and hence the code would get stuck every time for indefinite amount of time untill 
i realised by hit and trial method that this could be the reason.

to make the program you must understand the w1p2.cpp file provided to you but it was not easy
to concerntrate to each line of the given code.

the struct system used in this particular question is extremely complex and when using those 
structure we have to calculate the index number of those struct members and it gets very tough 
because it has multiple index position to be mentioned to reach a particular value.

counter variable used to mess up the data as i would forget to bring it back to zero when entering 
new value and sometimes the position at which the counter variable were used to matter a lot as it 
would lead to entering the data at wrong index.

everything instead of cin, cout, namespace. was taught earlier in ipc but some topics where i was weak
were required in completion of code which i had to go through again especially reading given txt file.
