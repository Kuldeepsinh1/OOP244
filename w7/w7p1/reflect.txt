Milestone 1 and workshop 7 collectively would make you revise almost all the concepts studied till 
Now some of the concepts learned in this Inheritance , abstract class , virtual functions, operator 
overloading,Like we used friend class menu in menuItem which is like using abstract class in the code.
The workshop 7 is basically divided in two parts VehicleBasic and dumper. The dumper part deals with 
cargo load unload and its capacity and vehicle basic is there to assign license plate number and other 
stuff and the concepts of inheritance is used where dumper is the child class of vehicleBasic class.
And in milestone 1 we have two class menu and menu item, menuItem is friend class of menu hence it can 
access private members of menu class.
